# Training of imaginary 2D grayscaled geological patterns
Training of imaginary 2D grayscaled geological patterns using a Convolutional Neural Network based model 

![alt text](train_data_classes.png)

Class 1 patterns are imaginary artefacts

Class 2 patterns are imaginary peaks

Class 3 patterns are imaginary flat (planar) areas

Run the scripts 'train_model.py' to train a model and 'test_images.py' to test the trained model with the images in the folder named 'test_images'.
